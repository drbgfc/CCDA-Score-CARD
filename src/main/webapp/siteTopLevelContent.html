      The C-CDA Scorecard leverages the work completed by an ONC-funded
      grant &mdash; <a
        href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/substitutable-medical-apps-reusable-technologies" target='_blank'>SMART
        (Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies)</a> and promotes
      best practices in C-CDA implementation by assessing key aspects of
      the structured data found in individual documents. It is a tool
      designed to allow implementers to gain insight and information
      regarding industry best practice and usage overall. It also
      provides a rough quantitative assessment and highlights areas of
      improvement which can be made today to move the needle forward.
      The <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/wg/structure/C-CDA%20Scorecard%20Rubrics%203.pptx" target="_blank"> 
      best practices and quantitative scoring criteria</a> have been
      developed by HL7 through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to
      improve the implementation of health care standards. We hope that
      providers and health IT developers will use the tool to identify
      and resolve issues of C-CDA document interoperability in their
      health IT systems.

      <b>Please Note:</b> The C-CDA Scorecard does not retain your submitted C-CDA file as
      the file is deleted from the server immediately after processing.
      However, we strongly suggest that you do not include any Protected
      Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information
      (PII) in your C-CDA file submissions to the Scorecard. Click <a
        href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>
      for more information on how to de-identify PHI.

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px">How to Interpret Results</h2>
    <p>The Scorecard tool provides two scores:
    <ol>
      <li>Certification Score</li>
      <li>Grade</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The "Certification Score" indicates whether the C-CDA document meets the requirements of the 
       2015 Edition Health IT Certification for Transitions of Care 170.315(b)(1) criteria and the result is indicated 
       simply as "Pass" or "Fail".</p>
    <p>Additionally, each C-CDA document is scored and graded for
      set of enhanced interoperability rules developed by HL7. A higher
      score (grade) means that information is coded with appropriate
      structure and semantics and hence has a better chance of
      interoperating with disparate systems. The maximum score is 100
      points and the grades are:
    <ul>
      <li>A+ (more than 94 points)</li>
      <li>A- (90 to 94 points)</li>
      <li>B+ (85 to 89 points)</li>
      <li>B- (80 to 84 points)</li>
      <li>C (70 to 79 points)</li>
      <li>D (less than 70 points)</li>
    </ul>
